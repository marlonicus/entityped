# Entityped

TypeScript ECS library that provides intellisense for your entities and components.

> I am building this for learning purposes.

## Prerequisites

All you need is a recent version of [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installing

Install the package with the following command:

```
npm install entityped
```

## Using

Run the following command from your project directory to create the initial boilerplate you need:

```
npx entityped-init
```

> Note: `npx` comes [installed with npm](<(https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner)>) and provides a clean way to run local scripts.


To create new components, just run the following command:

```
npx entityped-component
```
